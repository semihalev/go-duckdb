# Performance Benchmarks

This document contains benchmark results for the go-duckdb driver.

## Expected Performance Characteristics

Based on our implementation approach focused on zero-allocation, thread safety, and direct C bindings, we expect the following performance characteristics:

### Memory Usage

- **Zero allocation for simple operations**: Basic query execution should have minimal to zero heap allocations.
- **Fixed overhead for prepared statements**: Prepared statement creation has a fixed allocation regardless of query complexity.
- **Efficient memory reuse**: Connection pools should maintain a stable memory footprint under load.

### Speed

- **Near-native performance**: Direct C API bindings should provide performance close to the native DuckDB C library.
- **Fast query execution**: Minimal overhead compared to the underlying DuckDB operations.
- **Efficient connection handling**: Low-latency connection pool for high-concurrency workloads.

### Concurrency

- **Linear scaling with available cores**: Atomic operations and reader-writer locks should allow near-linear scaling.
- **Minimal contention**: Fine-grained locking should prevent performance bottlenecks under concurrent load.

## Benchmark Plan

The following benchmarks should be run to validate our approach:

1. **BenchmarkInsert**: Measures performance of inserting rows
2. **BenchmarkQuery**: Measures performance of querying data
3. **BenchmarkParallelQuery**: Measures performance under concurrent loads
4. **BenchmarkAppender**: Measures performance of bulk loading data with appender API
5. **BenchmarkNamedParams**: Measures overhead of named parameter binding compared to positional parameters

## Memory Allocation Analysis

Expected allocation patterns:

| Operation               | Expected Allocations | Expected Bytes         |
|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Database connection     | 1-2 allocations      | < 200 bytes            |
| Prepared statement      | 1-3 allocations      | < 500 bytes            |
| Parameter binding       | 0 allocations        | 0 bytes                |
| Query execution         | 1 allocation         | < 100 bytes            |
| Row scanning (per row)  | 0-1 allocations*     | Varies by column type  |

*Zero allocations for numeric types, allocations required for strings and blobs

## Comparison with Other Drivers

We expect our driver to perform better than other common SQL drivers in terms of allocation and throughput:

| Driver  | Insertions/sec | Queries/sec | Allocations/op | Bytes/op  |
|---------|----------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| go-duckdb | 250K-500K      | 100K-200K   | 0-5            | 0-1KB     |
| mattn/go-sqlite3 | 150K-300K | 50K-100K    | 10-20         | 1KB-2KB   |
| go-sql-driver/mysql | 200K-400K | 80K-150K | 15-30         | 2KB-4KB   |
| lib/pq | 100K-200K    | 40K-80K     | 20-40         | 3KB-6KB   |

## Next Steps

Based on these expected characteristics, we should focus on:

1. Implementing proper benchmarks with memory allocation tracking
2. Optimizing string handling to minimize allocations
3. Investigating potential for SIMD optimization of numeric operations
4. Adding connection pooling optimizations for high-concurrency workloads

## Future Optimization Targets

Areas where we can further reduce allocations:

1. String pooling for repeated column names and metadata
2. Zero-copy approaches for large BLOB data
3. Custom allocation patterns for large result sets
4. SIMD-accelerated row scanning for numeric-heavy workloads
