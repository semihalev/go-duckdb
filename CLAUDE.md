# Go-DuckDB Project Reference

## Project Overview
Go-DuckDB is a Go driver for DuckDB, focusing on high performance with native optimizations including SIMD support.

## Key Files
- `connection.go` - Connection represents a connection to a DuckDB database with CGO bindings
- `duckdb.go` - Core package implementation
- `native.go` - Native optimization layer implementation
- `native_fallback.go` - Pure Go fallbacks for when native code isn't available
- `native_result.go` - Result handling with native optimizations
- `parallel_api.go` - API for parallel execution patterns

## Current Priorities (from SIMD Roadmap)
1. Time-related operations optimizations
   - Implement SIMD-accelerated timestamp operations
   - Optimize date/time filtering and processing

2. Memory management enhancements
   - Implement tiered buffer pools
   - Add memory usage metrics and adaptive sizing
   - Create allocation-free conversion paths

3. Batch query optimizations
   - Optimize memory layout for cache efficiency
   - Implement column-wise filtering
   - Create specialized extractors for analytics patterns

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Completed batch execution implementation with proper memory management
- ✅ Implemented zero-copy mechanisms for string and BLOB data
- ✅ Fixed memory management issues in native code
- ✅ Implemented fallback capability for when native libraries aren't available
- ✅ Removed SIMD string operations after benchmarking showed slower performance than Go

## Key Lessons
- FFI overhead can outweigh SIMD benefits for simple operations
- Batch operations that cross the CGO boundary once provide significant performance benefits
- Go's string operations are already highly optimized and often outperform SIMD-accelerated C
- Focus native optimization efforts on compute-intensive operations where the work done justifies the FFI overhead
