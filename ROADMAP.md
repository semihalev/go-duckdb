# go-duckdb Project Roadmap

This document outlines the vision, roadmap, and development priorities for the go-duckdb project. It serves as a guide for future conversations and development efforts.

## Project Vision

Create the fastest, most reliable, zero-allocation DuckDB driver for Go, leveraging modern Go 1.23+ features while maintaining zero dependencies. The driver should be the clear choice for any Go developer working with DuckDB, from simple applications to high-performance data processing systems.

## Core Principles

1. **Zero Allocation** - Minimize GC pressure through careful memory management
2. **Zero Dependencies** - Maintain a pure Go implementation with no external dependencies beyond the standard library
3. **Thread Safety** - Guarantee thread-safe operations in all concurrent scenarios
4. **Performance First** - Prioritize performance in all design decisions
5. **Idiomatic Go** - Follow Go best practices and idioms
6. **Comprehensive API** - Support the full DuckDB feature set
