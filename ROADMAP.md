# go-duckdb Project Roadmap

This document outlines the vision, roadmap, and development priorities for the go-duckdb project. It serves as a guide for future conversations and development efforts.

## Project Vision

Create the fastest, most reliable, zero-allocation DuckDB driver for Go, leveraging modern Go 1.23+ features while maintaining zero dependencies. The driver should be the clear choice for any Go developer working with DuckDB, from simple applications to high-performance data processing systems.

## Core Principles

1. **Zero Allocation** - Minimize GC pressure through careful memory management
2. **Zero Dependencies** - Maintain a pure Go implementation with no external dependencies beyond the standard library
3. **Thread Safety** - Guarantee thread-safe operations in all concurrent scenarios
4. **Performance First** - Prioritize performance in all design decisions
5. **Idiomatic Go** - Follow Go best practices and idioms
6. **Comprehensive API** - Support the full DuckDB feature set

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Enhancements (Current)

- [x] Initial implementation with standard SQL interfaces
- [x] Thread-safety with atomic operations
- [x] Context support for cancellation
- [x] Basic transaction support
- [ ] Implement `driver.QueryerContext` and `driver.ExecerContext` for direct context support
- [ ] Implement `driver.NamedValueChecker` for better parameter binding
- [ ] Add connection configuration options (timeouts, cache settings)
- [ ] Add better error handling and detailed error messages

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

- [ ] Implement batched operations via `driver.Batch` interface
- [ ] Add support for DuckDB-specific data types
- [ ] Support for DuckDB extensions and custom functions
- [ ] Add session management capabilities
- [ ] Implement connection pooling optimizations
- [ ] Add prepared statement caching
- [ ] Implement bulk data loading optimizations
- [ ] Support for multi-result sets

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Add specialized zero-copy data transfer mechanisms
- [ ] Implement streaming for large datasets
- [ ] Add SIMD optimizations for common operations
- [ ] Create specialized memory pooling for large operations
- [ ] Optimize string handling with custom allocators
- [ ] Benchmark-driven optimizations against real-world workloads
- [ ] Compare and exceed performance of other database drivers

### Phase 4: Integration & Ecosystem

- [ ] Add integration with popular Go ORM libraries
- [ ] Create ecosystem of helper packages for specific use cases
- [ ] Implement GraphQL integration
- [ ] Add gRPC service examples
- [ ] Create Cloud-native deployment examples
- [ ] Develop comprehensive examples for common data processing tasks

## Infrastructure & Quality

- [ ] Establish CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Set up comprehensive test matrix across Go versions
- [ ] Implement fuzz testing for robustness
- [ ] Add performance regression testing
- [ ] Create benchmarking suite comparing to other databases
- [ ] Add code quality checks and static analysis
- [ ] Implement test coverage requirements (target: >90%)

## Documentation & Examples

- [ ] Create comprehensive godoc examples
- [ ] Write detailed usage documentation
- [ ] Add migration guides from other databases
- [ ] Create tutorials for common data tasks
- [ ] Add performance tuning guide
- [ ] Document internal architecture for contributors
- [ ] Create video demonstrations of key features

## Performance Targets

- Insert performance: 1M rows/second on standard hardware
- Query performance: Sub-millisecond response for simple queries
- Concurrent performance: Linear scaling to available CPU cores
- Memory usage: Fixed overhead regardless of operation size
- Zero allocation for standard operations

## Community Building

- [ ] Set up contribution guidelines
- [ ] Create community discussion channels
- [ ] Establish regular release cadence
- [ ] Develop showcase projects using the driver
- [ ] Present at Go conferences and meetups
- [ ] Write technical blog posts about implementation details

## Integration Priorities

1. **Data Science** - Make the driver work seamlessly with Go data science tools
2. **Web Applications** - Optimize for typical web application patterns
3. **ETL Pipelines** - Support high-throughput data processing workflows
4. **Embedded Applications** - Make the driver suitable for embedded and edge computing
5. **Cloud-Native** - Ensure the driver works well in containerized and serverless environments

## Future Exploration

- Potential for WASM compilation for browser use
- Investigation of advanced compilation techniques
- Exploration of GPU acceleration for certain operations
- Research into domain-specific optimizations for common workloads
